        <h2>Map of Australia and suspected fire locations in 2019-2020</h2>
        <p>The Map below demonstrates the scope of the fires across australia using data from NASA's MODIS satellite that measured the likelyhood of a fire using image processing software, therefore, the pixels bellow represent a 1x1 km square where and average temperature is meausred in kelvin. The fires were concentrated in Victoria and New South Wales; however the there were also fires in other regions of australia and thus an entire map of Australia is shown</p>

        <h2>What happend and why is this relevant?</h2>
        <p>The 2019-2020 bushfires in Australia, also known as "Black Summer," had a devastating impact on the environment, economy, and communities. Over 18 million hectares of land were burned, destroying thousands of homes, killing or displacing nearly three billion animals, and pushing some species closer to extinction. The fires also caused significant loss of life, with 33 people directly killed and hundreds more dying from smoke inhalation-related conditions. Ecologically, vast tracts of forests were scorched, altering ecosystems and increasing carbon emissions. Economically, the fires caused billions of dollars in damages, particularly to the agriculture, tourism, and insurance sectors. The long-term effects of the bushfires have raised urgent concerns about climate change, prompting calls for stronger environmental policies and firefighting strategies.</p>

    <h3>Destruction of Forest Ecosystems</h3>
    <p>The fires destroyed vast areas of forest, including temperate rainforests, eucalypt forests, and alpine ecosystems, which are vital to many species. In New South Wales, approximately 80% of the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area and more than 50% of the Gondwana rainforests were affected. Many of these forests, particularly rainforests, are not adapted to fire, making their recovery slow and uncertain.</p>
    <h3>Loss of Biodiversity</h3>
    <p>The bushfires led to the loss of an estimated 3 billion animals, including mammals, reptiles, birds, and frogs. This includes species that are unique to Australia, such as koalas, which suffered particularly severe population losses. In some areas, up to 30% of koala populations were killed, and others faced starvation due to the destruction of their food sources. Endangered species like the brush-tailed rock-wallaby and the greater glider were also heavily impacted, with some populations reduced to dangerously low numbers.</p>
    <h3>Impact on Plant Species</h3>
    <p>Many native plant species were either destroyed or severely affected. Eucalypt forests, which dominate much of the region, are adapted to fire, but the intensity and frequency of the 2019-2020 fires exceeded what many ecosystems could withstand. For some plant species that had slow recovery rates or were already rare, the fires posed a significant risk to their survival. Native grasses, shrubs, and undergrowth were also decimated, further impacting the animals that depend on them for food and shelter.</p>
